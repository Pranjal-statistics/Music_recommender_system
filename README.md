# Predicting Music Preferences using Collaborative Filtering

I along with my team developed a baseline collaborative filtering model for predicting the Music Preferences using the music branz dataset saved on Dataproc's HDFS. 
Leveraged Spark, Hadoop, Python and SQL to work on this machine learning model.
